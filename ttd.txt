Things to consider implementing before publishing app:
    - Create custom app icon
        - Use fiverr or something
    - Turn on magnify (Proguard)
    - Add analytics
        - Can use Firebase
    - Test on phones of various API versions
    - Consider translating strings
        - Put all hardcoded strings in res file
        - Have separate string res files for different languages
    - Take screenshots to highlight application in play store
    - For privacy policy:
        - create Google doc
            - can find templates online
            - make sure doc is visible to everyone
    - Look into search engine optimization
    - Name of the app in the play store listing should resemble what people might be searching for
